## Phonebook

Take your solution from the
[previous homework assignment](https://github.com/Vademandr/goit-react-woolf-hw-02-phonebook)
and add phonebook contact storage to `localStorage`. Use life cycle methods.

- When you add or remove a contact, the contacts are saved to local storage.
- When the application loads, the contacts, if any, are read from the local
  storage and written to the state.
